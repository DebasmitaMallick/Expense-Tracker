# Expense tracker App
## About the project

The expense tracker application using ReactJS is a tool designed to help users keep track of their expenses. The page consists of two main sections: an expense entry form and a list of previously entered expenses.

The expense entry form has field for the user to input the amount. The form also have two buttons: one for adding the entered amount to the list of expenses and one for removing the entered amount. Once the user submits the form, the data will be stored in the browser's local storage.

The second section of the application will display a list of previously entered expenses. The list will include the date of the expense, the amount spent, and the action (add or remove)

The expense tracker application using ReactJS is developed using best practices for code quality and maintainability.
